# Temporal Proteomics Multiple Imputation
Temporal proteomics data sets are often confounded by the challenges of missing values. These missing data points, in a time-series context, can lead to fluctuations in measurements or the omission of critical events, thus hindering the ability to fully comprehend the underlying biomedical processes. We introduce a Data Multiple Imputation (DMI) pipeline designed to address this challenge in temporal data set turnover rate quantifications, enabling robust downstream analysis to gain novel discoveries. To demonstrate its utility and generalizability, we applied this pipeline to two use cases: a murine cardiac temporal proteomics data set and a human plasma temporal proteomics data set, both aimed at examining protein turnover rates. This DMI pipeline significantly enhanced the detection of protein turnover rate in both data sets, and furthermore, the imputed data sets captured new representation of proteins, leading to an augmented view of biological pathways, protein complex dynamics, as well as biomarkerâ€“disease associations. Importantly, DMI exhibited superior performance in benchmark data sets compared to single imputation methods (DSI). In summary, we have demonstrated that this DMI pipeline is effective at overcoming challenges introduced by missing values in temporal proteome dynamics studies.
